In the `utils.py` file, you will add all the Dataset and Model classes you will implement according to the skeleton present in the file. In the notebook, you will add the data preprocessing pipeline for all the datasets, the training and testing pipelines of all implemented models and the report (See diagram below). \n",

        "3. At the end of the notebook, you will need to fill in a **report** template, providing the results of your implementation. We provide you with the template for the report, therefore you need to fill in the missing Markdown cells with the requested information. \n",

You will first explore the distribution of the input data and perform data cleaning and pre-processing. Then you will build two language model training and testing pipelines implementing an LSTM and a Transformer language model. You will play around with different hyperparameters.\n",

        "\n",
        "🔵 **What?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Language modeling (LM) is the use of various statistical and probabilistic techniques to determine the probability of a given sequence of words occurring in a sentence. Language models analyze bodies of text data to provide a basis for their word predictions. They are used in natural language processing (NLP) applications, particularly ones that generate text as an output. Some of these applications include, machine translation and question-answering.\n",
        "\n",
        "🟡 **How?**\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several different probabilistic approaches to modeling language, which vary depending on the purpose of the language model. From a technical perspective, the various types differ by the amount of text data they analyze and the math they use to analyze it (architecture). Some LMs we've already seen and will learn about during lectures are n-gram / count-based models, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformer models. \n",
        "\n",
        "🟣 **Why?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Language modeling is crucial in modern NLP applications. It is the reason that machines can understand qualitative information. Each language model type, in one way or another, turns qualitative information into quantitative information. This allows people to communicate with machines as they do with each other to a limited extent. It is used directly in a variety of industries including tech, finance, healthcare, transportation, legal, military and government. Additionally, it's likely most people reading this have interacted with a language model in some way at some point in the day, whether it be through Google search, an autocomplete text function or engaging with a voice assistant.\n",
